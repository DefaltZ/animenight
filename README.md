# Minimal Anime Website
An anime streaming website with good enough features. 

Inspired by https://animepahe.org

# Beta
Of course, it is not even close to complete. There are a lot of important features missing. And the code is not that optimised (spaghetti) at the moment. Occasionally, you may see things breaking. Just report them to me in the discord server (link below)

Feel free to contribute as well :)

# TODOS
1. Make the search experience better

3. Split some parts of the code in components
